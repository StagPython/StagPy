StagPy
======

StagPy is a command line tool to process the output files of your StagYY
simulations and produce high-quality figures.

This command line tool is built around a generic interface that allows you to
access StagYY output data directly in a Python script.

You can install StagPy from the [Python Package
Index](https://pypi.org/project/stagpy/).

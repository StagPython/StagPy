Installation
============

You will need Python 3.8 or higher to use StagPy. StagPy is available on
the Python Package Index, via ``pip``.

If you don't have sufficient permissions to install or update Python, you might
be interested in Miniconda_ or Anaconda_.

Installation using ``pip``
--------------------------

If you don't have ``pip`` for Python3 on your system, use the ``ensurepip``
module to install it (it is bootstrapped within the Python interpreter)::

    % python3 -m ensurepip

In case this doesn't work, download the official script
<https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py> and run it with ``python3``.

Then, update ``pip`` to the latest version::

    % python3 -m pip install -U pip

You can then install and/or update StagPy with the following command::

    % python3 -m pip install -U stagpy

Make sure that the directory where ``pip`` install package entry-points
(usually ``~/.local/bin``) is in your ``PATH`` environment variable.
You can run ``python3 -m pip show stagpy`` to obtain some hint about this
location (this command will show you were the compiled sources are installed,
e.g. ``~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages``, from which you can deduce the
entry-point location, e.g. ``~/.local/bin``).

See the `Some setup`_ subsection to enable autocompletion and create your
config file.

Some setup
----------

Run the following once to create your config file (in ``~/.config/stagpy/``)::

    % stagpy config --create

You can enable command-line auto-completion if you use either bash or zsh.

Add this to your ``~/.bashrc`` file::

    source ~/.config/stagpy/bash/stagpy.sh

Or this to your ``~/.zshrc`` file::

    source ~/.config/stagpy/zsh/_stagpy.sh

Enjoy!
